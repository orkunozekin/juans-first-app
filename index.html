    <h2><u> Early Life</u></h2>
    <div class="biography-and-pics">
      <p id="p-biography">-Inca Garcilaso De La Vega was born on April 12th of the year 1539 under the name of Gómez
        Suárez
        de Figueroa, in the city of Cuzco, located within the Governorate of New Castille, later renamed as the
        Viceroyalty
        of Peru of the Spanish Empire (current Peru).<br><br>
        He was born in the city of Cuzco, as the son of a couple between a Spanish conquistador named Sebastián
        Garcilaso
        de
        la Vega and a Native-American Inca princess named Isabel Chimpu Ocllo, who was the granddaughter of Emperor
        Túpac
        Yupanqui.<br><br>The father of Gómez Suárez de Figueroa was among the most trusted men of famous conquistador
        Francisco Pizarro, and because of this, he recieved from an early age one of the most privileged educations
        based
        of
        the culture of Europe in general and the Spanish Empire specifically. At the same time that he was learning the
        doctrines of Catholicism, writing, reading and mathematics through his lessons with his mentor Juan de
        Alcobaza,<br>
        Gómez Suárez de Figueroa spent a lot of time with his mother and the highest of the Inca nobility. Thanks to
        this,
        he learned Quechua (the language of the Incas), and gained access to the education and teachings of the
        "Amautas",
        who were the Inca's wise-people. From them, he learned vasts amounts of knowledge about the culture (mythology,
        history, traditions, etc.) of the Native-American Incas, from whom half of his blood lineage came from.

      <p id="p-biography"> Around the year 1553, Gómez Suárez de Figueroa's witnessed the rebellion of conquistador
        Francisco Hernández Girón against the king of Spain which took place in the Viceroyalty of Peru. Sebastián
        Garcilaso
        de la Vega's life, (his father's life) due to his position as the mayor of Cuzco, was at great risk so Gómez
        Suárez
        de Figueroa helped him escape through the rooftops of the city. Eventually, the rebellion failed and Sebastián
        Garcilaso de la Vega came back to occupy a political position in Cuzco. <br><br> His father, even before this
        event,
        always loved his son and held him in high esteem. He showed this affection in many ways throughout his life, and
        after his death in 1559, he left for a young Gómez Suárez de Figueroa through his final will, the sum of 4.000
        pesos
        of the finest gold and silver so he could go to peninnsular Spain to further develop and broaden his
        studies.<br><br>
        In 1560, Gómez Suárez de Figueroa traveled to the city of Lima to board into a ship that would take him to
        Spain.
        The travel ended up being of great danger but fortunately he made it to the penninsula. Once there, he stayed
        for
        a
        short time in the region of Extremadura with some distant relatives, later he established himself in the town of
        Montilla, within the region of Cordoba, where he met his uncle Alonso de Vargas. By the year 1561 he moved to
        Madrid
        in order to request from the royal crown special favors due to the position his father held in the Vicerroyalty
        of
        Peru and the services he provided. Nevertheless, the crown denied his requests based on the fact that his father
        onced helped the rebel of the crown Gonzalo Pizarro (brother of Francisco Pizarro) by lending him a horse to
        escape
        from the battle of Huarina (this information was refutated by official chroniclers of the
        Americas).<br><br>Feeling
        disappointed after the response he recieved, he requested the permit to go back to Peru. The permit was granted
        but
        he kept postponing it over and over after the birth of his only known son, Diego de Vargas (product of a
        relationship with a woman named Beatriz De Vega). Eventually, around 1563, he decided to join the Spanish
        Tercios
        and pursue a military career like his father before him.<br><br> He abandoned his name and he began to be called
        "Inca Garcilaso De La Vega". Name that he would carry until the end of his life...
